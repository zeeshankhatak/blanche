== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I only display posts that use a specific Instagram hashtag? =

With [Spotlight Pro](https://spotlightwp.com/pricing/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=readme_faq&utm_campaign=readme_faq_hashtag) you can use either of the two options.

First, you can choose to display posts that include a specific hashtag from all across Instagram. ([Learn more](https://docs.spotlightwp.com/article/622-how-to-display-hashtag-feeds)).

Second, you can use Hashtag filtering to show or hide posts from your connected Instagram account that use a specific hashtag. [Learn more.](https://spotlightwp.com/features/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=readme_faq&utm_campaign=readme_faq_hashtagfeed)

- - -

= Can I display posts from multiple Instagram accounts in one gallery? =

Yes. With Spotlight you can create feeds that feature photos and videos from multiple Instagram accounts within the same feed. Simply connect the Instagram user accounts you want to display posts from and select them in the "Connect" step of the feed editor in Spotlight.

- - -

= How do I connect my Instagram account? =

Once you install Spotlight, a welcome screen appears that guides you on how to connect your first Instagram user account. Click on the connect button and it will show you two options, [Personal or Business](https://docs.spotlightwp.com/article/553-what-is-the-difference-between-instagram-personal-and-business-accounts). Pick the one that applies to you, authorise Spotlight through the popup that appears and you’re all set.

- - -

= How many Instagram accounts can I connect? =

Spotlight has no limit on the number of Instagram accounts you may connect. So long as you have legitimate access to those accounts, you can connect them directly through Spotlight or by using an Instagram access token (for developers).

- - -

= Where can I find my Instagram Access Token and User ID? =

Option 1: Use Spotlight's [Access Token Generator](https://spotlightwp.com/access-token-generator/).

Option 2: If your Instagram account is already connected in Spotlight, go to Instagram Feeds > Settings. From the first page, Accounts, click on the Instagram username or the "info" option under Actions. Enter your admin account's password to view the access token details.

- - -

= How many feeds can I set up and display? =

Spotlight sets no limit on the number of feeds you can set up. Design one for your footer, another for the sidebar, and one to fill an entire page - let your imagination run free. You can even show multiple feeds on the same page!

- - -

= Can I display multiple Instagram feeds on the same page or site? =

Yes. With Spotlight you can embed multiple Instagram feeds on a single page, a single post, in widget areas, and across your entire website. There are no limits and each feed can be unique or re-used in multiple places.

- - -

= Can I show full-size photos and play Instagram videos directly on my website? =

Yes, Spotlight's free version includes a lightbox (popup) that will display your photos and playable videos in their full size over your entire website. Keep site visitors exactly where you want them - on your website!

If you want to enhance the popup, [Spotlight PRO adds a sidebar](https://spotlightwp.com/pricing/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=readme_faq&utm_campaign=readme_faq_fullsizeandvideos) to the lightbox which will display your Instagram captions, comments, published date, and more.

- - -

= Can I hand-pick specific posts to hide or show in my Instagram feed? =

Yes, we understand that you may have certain posts that you don't want to show on your website. By using the Moderation option in Spotlight Pro you can hand-pick the photos and videos that you either want to show or hide on your website. [Learn more.](https://spotlightwp.com/features/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=readme_faq&utm_campaign=readme_faq_moderation)
